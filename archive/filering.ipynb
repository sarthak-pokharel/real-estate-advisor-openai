The southern part ends with one block, on the east side, in City of London; the rest is in the London Borough of Islington, the north end being Angel. It crosses Old Street/Clerkenwell Road. In the north it splits Clerkenwell from Finsbury; the south was sometimes used as a demarcator but all but the southern corporate/legal/financial end in the modern era forms the heart of the highly developed mixed-use district Barbican.\\nAll of the road is inside the Central London congestion charge zone.\\n\\nPage: Farringdon, London\\nSummary: Farringdon is an area in London and is located in the London Borough of Islington. It lies just north of the border with the City of London in Central London and close to Holborn. The term is used to describe the area around Farringdon station.\\nHistorically the district corresponded to southern Clerkenwell and the small parish of St Sepulchre Middlesex. The area's name is a back-formation: It takes its name from the station, which was in turn named after Farringdon Street. To the south lie the City of London wards of Farringdon Within and Farringdon Without. The City Wards, which were once a single unit, are unconnected to the distinct area of Farringdon to their north, though there is an etymological connection.\""
